## Description 

As I learn and grow as a developer, I wanted one place where I could showcase my projects and provide other developers and potential employers more information about who I am.

This project was created using solely HTML with CSS styling.

This page includes a small bio with a photo of me:

There is a section to list my skills as well as a list of buttons that take you to various documents and pages that give more information about me as a developer and professional:

When the "Projects" button is clicked, it takes you to another page showcasing three of my projects. Each project has a screenshot of the deployed page along with a link to its corresponding GitHub repository and a link to its live page.
